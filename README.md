# Emergency Room Patient Visit Analytics

# 📍 The Context

Emergency rooms are high-pressure environments where patient flow, wait times, and service experience directly impact care quality.
As patient volumes grow, hospitals need clear, data-driven visibility into how their ER is functioning on a daily basis.

This project uses ER visit data to understand who is coming in, when demand peaks, how long patients wait, and where operational gaps exist.

# ⚠️ The Problem

Hospital administrators often struggle to answer key operational questions such as:

Are patients waiting longer at certain times or demographics?

Which services and departments see the highest demand?

Is patient satisfaction being captured effectively?

How is ER demand changing over time?

Without a consolidated view, identifying bottlenecks and planning resources becomes difficult.

# 🔎 The Approach

I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that brings together patient visits, demographics, satisfaction, and wait times into a single, decision-ready view.

The analysis focused on:

Visit volume and appointment types

Patient satisfaction and feedback coverage

Demographic patterns across age, gender, and race

Departmental referrals and service usage

Wait time patterns and yearly demand growth

# 📊 What the Data Revealed

# Patient Flow & Visit Patterns

A total of 4,632 ER visits were analyzed, split almost evenly between administrative (49.35%) and non-administrative (50.65%) appointments

ER usage was significantly higher on weekdays (3.3K visits) compared to weekends (1.3K visits)

# Patient Experience & Satisfaction

The average satisfaction rating was 5.45, indicating room for improvement

75.71% of services were unrated, highlighting gaps in feedback collection and patient engagement

# Demographic Insights

Adults accounted for 78% of visits, suggesting demand is concentrated in adult care

Gender distribution was nearly even (51.5% male, 48.2% female)

Wait time heatmaps revealed variation across age and race groups, pointing to potential equity and efficiency concerns

# Departmental Utilization

No Department Referrals (2.7K visits) formed the largest category, suggesting many patients either sought general consultation or were not routed further

Among referrals, General Practice (0.9K) and Orthopedics (0.5K) saw the highest demand

# Wait Times & Operational Load

The overall average wait time was 35.53 minutes

Certain demographic groups experienced consistently longer waits, signaling opportunities for operational improvements

# Demand Growth Over Time

ER visits increased from 2,177 in 2019 to 2,455 in 2020, a 12.8% year-over-year growth

This upward trend indicates increasing pressure on ER resources

# 💡 Key Takeaways

Operational gaps exist in wait times and feedback collection

Demand is growing, requiring proactive staffing and planning

Patient routing and engagement can be improved, especially for non-referred visits

Data visibility enables more equitable and efficient ER operations

# ✅ Outcome

This dashboard enables healthcare stakeholders to:

Monitor ER congestion and wait times

Identify demographic and service-level disparities

Improve patient experience tracking

Support data-driven staffing and operational decisions
